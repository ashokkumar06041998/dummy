these commands are used to merge branches,
when you complete you modification with subbranch then, 
you need to add the modified code /created file or to main from subbranches.

Example :  
    step1:
     command : " git branch " 
     output : subbranch2(current directory)

    step2: 
     command : " git add ." 
     output : U or M letters will be removed from file corner.

    step3:
     command : "  git commit -m "git_merge_branch.txt was modified" " 
     output : [subbranch2 95bd84b] git_merge_branch.txt was modified

    step4:
     command : "  git push origin subbranch" 
     output : those files will be oushed into remote subbranch(github repo subbranch2).

    step5:
     command : " git switch main " or "git checkout main" 
     output : main(current directory)

    step6:
     command : " git pull origin main " 
     output : latest files from remote main(github repository main) will be pulled into local main.

    step7:
     command : " git merge subbranch " 
     output : this command will merge the subbranch2 with main branch locally.

     step8: 
     command: "git push origin main"
     output: this command will push the local main to remote main(github repository maon)
