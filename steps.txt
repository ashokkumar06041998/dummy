Step 1 :To initialize github in terminal " git init" 

            Note: git init will initialize the github in local machine and creates a folder for github,
            if you didn't login before it will ask you login into you github account to initialize.
            this, command creates ".git" sub directory to store all files ,this foler works as intermidiate 
            from your machine to github repository.when you create/modify an file it shows U as not added
            then you you need to use add command to stage the changes
            

Step 2 :To Add file in github "git add filename.format"  or "git add ."
            this command stages changes of the files or a specific file.
            for example if you have created/modified some files you need to use 
            this command to stage(preparing changes) the modified files.this command does it.
            To add multiple files that you craeted/modified use,
            "git add ."


Step 3 :To Commit the Changes "git commit -m "write something about the file creation/modifies""
            
Step 4 :To Push the Files to github Repositoty "git push origin main"
