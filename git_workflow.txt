Step 1:  Pull latest changes from remote "main" branch to your local "main" branch:
             command : "git pull origin main"


Step 2:  Create and switch to "demo-branch" to make your changes:
             command : "git checkout -b demo-branch"


Step 3:  Make your changes, stage them, and commit:
            commands : 
                            git add .  # Stage all changes
                             git commit -m "Your commit message"  # Commit your changes


Step 4: Switch back to "main" branch to integrate "demo-branch":
            command : "git switch main"


Step 5:  Merge "demo-branch" into "main":
            command : "git merge demo-branch"


Step 6: Push the changes to the "remote main"(github repo main) branch:
            command : "git push origin main"
